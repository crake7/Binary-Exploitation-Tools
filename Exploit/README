This part requires you to set up a few things in order to use the shellcode.py script. It greatly simplifies this task by having a function that generates a 
shellcode for you using Python format. However, you need to set up the following things:

- Install pymetasploit3 (https://pypi.org/project/pymetasploit3/)

$ pip3 install --user pymetasploit3 

- Start the Metasploit RPC server on port 55553 by creating a password:

$ msfrpcd -P yourpassword -S

- Verify the process is running on your machine:

$ netstat -tulnp 


Great! Now you can go on and modify the Python script. You will notice that I added a function called sub_ESP_10 instead of using NOPs. 
All you need to do is generate assembly instructions avoing using the previously found badchars. 

If you are curious to learn why I used that function, I highly recommend to check the tutorial by Justin Steven:
