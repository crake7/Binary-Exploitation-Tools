Find_EIP folder contains 4 files:

-find_eip.py
-pattern.py 
-pattern_create.rb
-pattern_offset.rb

The first two files find_eip.py and pattern.py are meant to work together. If you want to be able to use the python3 version of "pattern_create.rb", 
you will have to download the file pattern.py and place it on the same directory as find_eip.py.
-When generating cyclic patterns, you'll have to use the 'payload' variable in quotations.  


The last two files: pattern_create.rb and pattern_offset.rb are just there in case you prefer to generate your cyclic pattern using the good ol' Metasploit framework.
Please note that you will have to copy paste the results in payload. You will have to do some extra tweaking but you are free to use this option as well. 
Again, I strongly suggest you simply use the first two files. 



Big thanks to Svenito for creating the pattern.py script! If you want to learn more about how to use it, check:
